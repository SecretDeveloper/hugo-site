## Development
Programmer, System designer, and Technical Lead on a variety of large enterprise projects and solutions including Websites, Windows Services and large SOA systems. Other than that I play with all sorts of different technologies when I find the time.  Right now I am interested in javascript/ajax/coffeescript/functional programming/knockoutjs/underscore and lots of others.  If I learn something new each day then I am happy.
